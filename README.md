# Restaurant-Page - [Live Preview](https://robisonwebdev.github.io/Restaurant-Page/)

## Objective
The objective of the Restaurant Page project is to create a website using mostly JavaScript. To achive this objective, I will be learning to 
install and work with webpack. To create the HTML I will need, I will use JavaScript to build the HTML and spliting up the project into multiple modules and exporting/importing them to work together.
